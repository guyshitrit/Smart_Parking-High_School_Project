The "Smart Parking" project is designed to replace regular parking lot systems by introducing automation to the process. 
The project features a closed parking lot with 16 parking spaces arranged in a 4x4 grid, where each space is equipped with a magnetic sensor that signals the system when the elevator reaches the designated location.
The elevator, constructed using rods, moves vertically and horizontally along rails, controlled by motors.

Access to the parking lot is managed through a fingerprint sensor at the entry point, ensuring secure and streamlined access.
The system features two gates—one for entry and one for exit—while all operations and instructions are displayed on an LCD screen.

The key innovation of this project lies in its automation, allowing drivers to avoid the need to manually navigate and search for parking.
The system autonomously locates an available space and parks the vehicle, simulating the functionality of a fully automated parking system in a prototype form.
